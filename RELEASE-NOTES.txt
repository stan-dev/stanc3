STANC3 RELEASE NOTES
======================================================================

v2.33.0 (5 September 2023)
======================================================================

- Added tuple types to the language (#1100)
- The following deprecations have been turned into errors this version:
    - The old array syntax, e.g. `int arr[5];`. Use `array[5] int arr;` instead.
    - Distribution functions ending in `_log`. Use either `_lpdf` or `_lpmf`.
    - The functions `binomial_coefficient_log`, `multiply_log`, and `cov_exp_quad`. Use `lchoose`, `lmultiply`, and `gp_exp_quad_cov` respectively.
    - The `if_else` function. Use the ternary operator  `cond ? true_value : false_value`
    - Use of CDFs with a `,` between the first and second argument. Use a `|`.
    - Comments beginning with `#`. Use `//`.
    - Use of `<-` for assignment. Use `=`.
    - The `increment_log_prob` function. Use the `target +=` statement.
    - The `get_lp()` function. Use `target()`.
    - The use of nested multi-indices on the left hand side of an assignment statement.
    For this version, these can all be automatically updated with the `--canonicalize=deprecations` argument to the autoformatter. This is not guaranteed to work for versions _following_ this one.
    Additionally, the following identifiers are now reserved words: `array`, `offset`, `multiplier`, `lower`, and `upper`.
    (#1287)
- Exposed vectorized signatures for `log_sum_exp` (#1344)
- Exposed new functions `qr`, `qr_thin`,  `eigendecompose_sym`, `eigendecompose`, `complex_schur_decompose`, `svd`, and `csr_extract`. (#1346)
- Added a `log_prob_impl` specialization specifically for reverse mode to improve code generation (#1327)
- Fixed an issue where returning array literals could produce the wrong types in C++. (#1335)
- Fixed an issue with leading zeroes in real literals like `0E0` (#1336)
- Fixed a bug with type promotion in the arguments to user-defined distributions generating bad C++. (#1338)
- Fixed optimization logic for deducing whether mixes of scalars, data matrices, and autodiff matrices can be promoted to SoA (#1347)
- Fixed an issue with the partial evaluator crashing on statements containing a mod-by-zero. (#1351)
- `--filename-in-msg` now also affects the name of the file shown in runtime exceptions. Useful for interfaces which use mangled or temporary names during compilation. (#1339)
- Improved error message provided when the wrong return type is returned from a function.
    Return statements now follow the same type promotion rules as assignment and function argument passing.
    The typechecker now allows infinite loops (`while (1)` without an internal `break`) to be the end of a returning function. Previously, an (unreachable) return statement was needed following the loop.
    (#1341)
- Improved error messages for unsupported type in reduce_sum (#1332)
- Improved error messages when using a reserved word as a variable name. (#1343)

v2.32.1 (2 May 2023)
======================================================================

- The shapes and sizes of parameter initial values are now checked against the specified sizes in the model before being read in, matching the existing behavior for data. (#1316)
  **Note:** This change may cause existing code which worked "by accident" to raise new errors about mismatches between the model's declarations and the provided initialization.
- Errors in transform_inits should now properly highlight the location in the original Stan program. (#1318)
- Fixed an issue where the `--debug-generate-inits` debug flag would fail badly if parameter sizes depended on data (#1319)

v2.32.0 (20 April 2023)
======================================================================

- Syntax removals scheduled for this version have been pushed back to 2.33. We still recommend updating your Stan models as you are able. As a reminder, deprecated syntax which will be removed in minor versions can as a rule be updated automatically using find-and-replace tools or the [Stan compiler's auto-formatting abilities](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/stanc-pretty-printing.html). (#1303)
- The deprecated `--include_paths` and `--allow_undefined` arguments have been removed, use `--include-paths` and `--allow-undefined`. (#1303)
- Recursive user-defined functions no longer need forward declarations. (#1277)
- Added overloads to `eigenvalues` and `eigenvectors` which accept a complex matrix as input. (#1282)
- Fixed an issue where `profile` blocks could generate uncompilable C++ when used with `--O1`. (#1281)
- Fixed an issue where the compiler would generate uncompilable C++ when a matrix expression featured mixed types of elements. (#1292)
- Fixed an issue where a user-defined-function expecting real arguments could be passed an integer and exhibit integer behavior like truncating division. (#1296)
- Fixed an issue where external functions could not be used in higher-order functions without the end-user supplying an implementation of our functor structs. (#1298)
- Fixed a bug in `transform_inits` for models which used complex types (#1305)
- Improved the error shown when an `#include`d file cannot be found to list the paths it searched on. (#1273)
- Improved `--filename-in-msg` for the command line version of `stanc`. Errors now use the requested name, not just warnings. (#1274)
- Refactored how C++ is code-generated in the compiler. (#1233)
- Added tests for various parts of the C++ backend which weren't previously tested, and added a `--debug-lir` flag to print out the C++ representation in a s-expression. (#1276)
- Updated code generate of `get_param_names` (#1245)
- Switched to `std::endl` instead of `'\n'` to end prints. (#1301)
- Added a new function `unconstrain_array` to the generated code. This is currently not exposed. (#1305)
- Added a `--debug-generate-inits` flag to stanc which behaves like `--debug-generate-data` but for declarations in the `parameters` block. (#1306)
- Sped up some code which is critical to parsing. (#1302)

v2.31.0 (21 November 2022)
======================================================================

- Improved the error message for bad multiple declarations. (#1239)

- `print` and `reject` will now be listed as functions in `stanc --info`s output. (#1257)
- Added quantile functions (inverse-CDFs) `std_normal_qf` and `std_normal_log_qf`. `std_normal_qf` is a synonym for `inv_Phi`, and `std_normal_log_qf` is the same but with the input on the log-scale.(#1258)
- Fix using `reject()` with container types. (#1261)
- Vectorized sampling statements can now be used with the truncation syntax `T[ , ]`(#1263)
- Functions which return integer types are considered as "data" for purposes of data-only arguments.(#1265)
- The negation operator `-` can now accept arrays, e.g. `array[N] int foo = {...}; print(-foo);`(#1266)
- Exposes algebraic functions with a variadic arguments, using the following four functions: `solve_powell`, `solve_powell_tol`, `solve_newton` and `solve_newton_tol`.  Relevant changes to Stan-math are already merged.(#1268)

v2.30.1 (27 July 2022)
======================================================================

- Improved the pedantic mode warning for parameters without priors. The message now highlights when it is safe to ignore it.
- Fixed a bug in the memory pattern optimization where a for loop generated for the function inliner would prevent detection of for loops higher in the control flow graph.
- Fixed an issue with the function inliner when a function local variable had the same name as a variable in the calling scope.
- Fixed an issue where recursive functions which called themselves with a slice of their arguments would lead to infinite template expansion in C++ compilation.
- Fixed a bug in stanc.js where the stanc flags were not listed correctly in the generated C++.
- The imaginary components of complex vectors and matrices are now initialized to NaN to match the real component and behaviour of non-complex vectors and matrices.

v2.29.1 (2 March 2022)
======================================================================

- Formatting without a | when only one argument is supplied to a distribution.

 - User defined functions can now be overloaded. Multiple definitions of the same function name are allowed if the arguments are different in each definition.(#1027)
 - Improved error messages for incorrect variable declarations. (#1099)
 - When an unknown identifier is encountered Stan will suggest nearby known names you might have meant (#1024)

 - The canonicalizer can now have each part enabled seperately. This can be done with commands like `stanc --auto-format --canonicalize=braces,deprecations <model>`. Current options are `deprecations`, `braces`, and `parenthesis`. (#1058)
 - Ensure the canonicalizer properly prints nested if-else statements. (#1055)
 - `--auto-format` no longer prints code which originated from an `#include` directive. This can be re-enabled by using `canonicalize=includes`. (#1069)

 - Added a warning for `matrix^scalar` that points users to `.^` and `matrix_power()`. (#1026)
 - Warn about the following identifiers being reserved in a future version: `array`, `upper`, `lower`, `offset`, `multiplier`. (#1048)
 - The old form of declaring arrays like `real a[5]`, which has been deprecated since 2.26, now issues a warning. (#1072)

- cleaned up the OCaml code: better use of helper functions, removed duplicate functions, better exception messages, replace imperative code for handling Stan Math signatures
- size expressions for parameters and generated quantities are now only evaluated once
- better handle model names that are not C++ friendly (start with numbers, have non-alphanumeric characters)

Bugfixes:
- changed the loop index type to int to prevent issues when using it in expressions with signed numbers
- integer arrays now initialize to the smallest representable integer
- var arrays initialize with a prebuilt dummy var, to not creat new varis
- all map_rect calls are registered when using MPI
- _lpdf/_lpmf functions are now used instead of *_log when generating code for the tilde statements
- single argument distribution do not require the vertical bar anymore (e.g. std_normal_lpdf(x|))
- fixed a bug that caused tilde statements to conflict with userdef functions
- rng functions are no longer allowed in size declarations
- fixed the _lpdf functor struct so that UDF with _log and int argument now compile
- fixed array literal type-checking
- fixed the error messages for missing input (line number is now displayed properly)
- fixed indexing in transform_init()
- fixed emitting generated quantities only (for gq_writer)
- fixed debug data generator for constrained matrix types and added array value bounds
