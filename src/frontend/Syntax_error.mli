type t

(** This is the type of format strings with no %-placeholders.
    Why? Because we can still include other formatting
    indicators, including semantic tags used for things like
    ["@{<green>Colored text@}"].
    These strings usually come from the [parser.messages] text file. *)
type styled_text = (unit, Format.formatter, unit) format

val location : t -> Middle.Location_span.t
val kind : t -> string
val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(** Exception-based control flow is useful during parsing/lexing.
    These helpers are used to try to keep all that logic in one place*)

val unexpected_eof : Middle.Location_span.t -> 'a
val unexpected_character : Middle.Location_span.t -> 'a
val include_error : string -> Middle.Location_span.t -> 'a
val parse_error : styled_text -> Middle.Location_span.t -> 'a
val try_with : (unit -> 'a) -> ('a, t) result
