(** Pretty print a complete Stan program.

    This module relies on [Parser] to be able to run a "sanity check" on the
    output of the pretty printer, confirming that the output is a valid Stan
    program and matches the input program.

    However, the parser relies on some pretty printing functions to be able to
    produce nicer error messages, hence the split between [Pretty_printing] and
    this module. *)
