val init : unit -> unit
(** As something of a hack, Input_warnings keeps track of which warnings the lexer has
    emitted as a form of hidden state, which must be initialized and [collect]ed.*)

val collect : unit -> Middle.Warnings.t list
(** Returns all of the warnings issued since [init] was called. *)

val add_warning : Middle.Location_span.t -> string -> unit
(** Add a generic warning string to the current list *)

val deprecated : string -> Lexing.position * string -> unit
(** Register that a deprecated language construct has been found. *)

val empty : string -> unit
(** Register that an empty file is being lexxed *)
