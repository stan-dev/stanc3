   Simultaneously builds the controlflow parent graph, the predecessor graph and the exit
   set of a statement. It's advantageous to build them together because they both rely on
   some of the same Break, Continue and Return bookkeeping.

   Takes a statement map and returns the triple:
     (exit set, predecessor graph, controlflow parent graph)
   where
     * (exit set, predecessor graph) is the return value of build_predecessor_graph
     * (controlflow parent graph) is the return value of build_cf_graph

   Building the controlflow graph requires a traversal with state that includes continues,
   breaks, returns and the controlflow graph accumulator. The traversal should be a
   branching traversal with set unions rather than a forward traversal because continue
   and return statements shouldn't affect other branches of execution.

(**
   Building the predecessor graph requires a traversal with state that includes the
   current previous nodes and the predecessor graph accumulator. Special cases are made
   for loops, because they should include the body exits as predecessors to the body, and
   they should include loop predecessors in their exit sets. I'm not sure if the single
   re-traversal of the loop body is sufficient or this requires finding a fixed-point.

(**
   The statement map is built by traversing substatements recursively to replace
   substatements with their labels while building up the substatements' statement maps.
   Then, the result is the union of the substatement maps with this statement's singleton
   pair, which is expressed in terms of the new label-containing statement.
