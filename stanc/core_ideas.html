There are a few differences from the OCaml standard library which are instantly noticeable:</p><ul><li><p>Most higher-order functions such as <code>List.map</code> take a <i>named</i> function argument.</p><p>This means a call like <code>List.map square [1;2;3]</code> will look like <code>List.map ~f:square [1;2;3]</code>.</p></li><li><p>Core defaults to safe operations which return <i>options</i> rather than possibly erring.</p><p>In &quot;normal&quot; OCaml, <code>List.hd</code> has type <code>'a list -&gt; 'a</code>. A call <code>List.hd []</code> will throw an exception. By contrast, in the Jane Street libraries, the same function has type <code>'a list -&gt; 'a option</code>.</p><p>Usually, a function with the suffix <code>_exn</code> recovers the original signature, e.g. <code>List.hd_exn : 'a list -&gt; 'a </code>.</p></li></ul><p>If for some reason you <em>need</em> functionality from the OCaml standard library that is not available in Jane Street (be sure to triple check), you can use the module <code>Stdlib</code> to access the built-in versions.</p><p>There are a few other things we gain from these libraries. The most important idea to understand is <b>deriving</b>.</p><h3 id="deriving-functions"><a href="#deriving-functions" class="anchor"></a>Deriving functions</h3><p>If you look at a type declaration of something like <code>Ast.typed_expression</code>, you'll notice something curious after the declaration:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>type typed_expression = (typed_expr_meta, fun_kind) expr_with
[@@deriving sexp, compare, map, hash, fold]</code></pre><p>When using an editor that supports code completion, you may notice that the <code>Ast</code> module suggests functions which are not defined in the actual source text. This is because these functions are created at compile time by <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving"><code>ppx_deriving</code></a>.The above syntax <code>[@@deriving ...]</code> indicates which functions we would like to be generated.</p><p>These are very helpful - if a type derives <code>hash</code>, it can automatically be used as keys in Jane Street's hash tables, and a type which derives <code>sexp</code> can be serialized to Lisp-style S-Expressions. Most of our major types derive at least one function.</p><h2 id="&quot;two-level-types&quot;"><a href="#&quot;two-level-types&quot;" class="anchor"></a>&quot;Two Level Types&quot;</h2><p>The other curious thing about the types we define in our AST and MIR is that they use a trick known as &quot;two level types&quot;. This allows re-using the same type structure with different amounts of metadata attached (e.g., before type checking we have an <code>untyped_program</code> which only has nodes and their source locations, after type checking we have <code>typed_program</code> which features nodes, locations, <i>and</i> types, in the same basic tree structure.</p><p>The way that this is implemented is a bit non-obvious at first. Essentially, many of the tree variant types are parameterized by something that ends up being a placeholder not for just metadata but for the recursive type including metadata, sometimes called the fixed point. So instead of recursively referencing <code>expression</code>, you would instead reference type parameter <code>'e</code>, which will later be filled in with something like <code>type expr_with_meta = metadata expression</code>.</p><p>This takes some getting used to, and also can lead to some unhelpful type signatures in editors such as VSCode, because abbreviations are not always used in hover-over text. For example, <code>Expr.Typed.t</code>, the MIR's typed expression type, actually has a signature of <code>Expr.Typed.Meta.t Expr.t</code>.</p><h2 id="the-fmt-library-and-pretty-printing"><a href="#the-fmt-library-and-pretty-printing" class="anchor"></a>The <code>Fmt</code> library and pretty-printing</h2><p>We extensively use the <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/fmt">Fmt</a> library for our pretty-printing and code generation. We have an existing guide on the <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3/wiki/Format---Fmt-code-generation-quickstart">wiki</a> which covers the core ideas.</p></div></body></html>
