{0 Exposing New Functions to stanc3}



{1 Background}

For a function to be built into Stan, it has to be included in the Stan Math library and its signature has to be
exposed to the compiler.

To do the latter, we have to add a corresponding line in [src/stan_math_signatures/Generate.ml].
The compiler uses the signatures defined there to do type checking. (Aside: this file generates a
binary representation of the signatures, which is then stored in the executable. This is faster
than re-generating the list of signatures every time the compiler is run.)


{1 Adding a distribution function }
To add a distribution, we have to find the line containing [let distributions =]. The existing distributions can be
used for reference. The first argument defines the kind of function we want to add.
The second argument is the base function name without the [_...] suffixes. The third argument specifies
the argument types of the function. The last argument describes the memory pattern supported by this function, either an
Array of Structs (AoS) or a Struct of Arrays (SoA). The following line exposes a function [foo_lpdf] which takes in
a (non-vectorizable) real number and a (non-vectorizable) integer :
{[
  ; ([Lpdf], "foo", [DReal; DInt], SoA)
]}

To see the exact signatures created, we can recompile stanc using [make all] and display the signatures using
[stanc --dump-stan-math-signatures]. By filtering for [foo] (for example by using [grep]), we get the
following output:
{[
$ stanc --dump-stan-math-signatures | grep foo
foo_lpdf(real, int) => real
]}

If we want to allow the first parameter to be vectorizable, we can change the signature to
{[
  ; ([Lpdf], "foo", [DVReal; DReal], SoA)
]}

This produces the following signatures:
{[
$ stanc --dump-stan-math-signatures | grep foo
foo_lpdf(real, int) => real
foo_lpdf(vector, int) => real
foo_lpdf(row_vector, int) => real
foo_lpdf(array[] real, int) => real
]}
As we can see, allowing a parameter to be vectorized automatically produces signatures where
the parameter is either [base type], [vector], [row_vector] or [array[]].

{2 Available parameter types}

The following parameter types are available:
- [DInt]: Scalar integer -> [int]
- [DReal]: Scalar real number -> [real]
- [DVector]: Vector -> [vector]
- [DMatrix]: Matrix -> [matrix]
- [DIntArray]: Integer array -> [array[] int]
- [DVInt]: Vectorizable integer -> [int; array[] int]
- [DVReal]: Vectorizable real number -> [real; vector; row_vector; array[] real]
- [DVectors]: Vectorizable vectors (for multivariate functions) -> [vector, row_vector, array[] vector, array[] row_vector]
- ([DDeepVectorized]: all base types with up to 8 levels of nested containers)

{2 Available types of distribution functions}
As we have seen above, specifying our function as [[Lpdf]] added the suffix [_lpdf] to our base function name.
There are several types available which specify the suffixes that will be added:
- [Lpmf]: [_lpmf]
- [Lpdf]: [_lpdf]
- [Rng]: [_rng]
- [Cdf]: [_cdf, _lcdf]
- [Ccdf]: [_lccdf]

Additionally, [full_lpdf] combines all suffixes of [Lpdf], [Rng], [Ccdf] and [Cdf]. [full_lpmf] does the same, but
using the suffixes of [Lpmf] instead of [Lpdf]. Note that these two have to be used without brackets. This means we would
write
{[
  ; ([Cdf], "foo", [DReal; DInt], SoA)
]}
but
{[
  ; (full_lpdf, "foo", [DReal; DInt], SoA)
]}
which corresponds to
{[
  ; ([Lpdf; Rng; Ccdf; Cdf], "foo", [DReal; DInt], SoA)
]}

{1 Adding a normal function}
Standard functions (e.g., not distributions or variadic functions) are added to a list in the same file.
This list begins near the bottom of the file with the line

{[
(* -- Start populating stan_math_signaturess -- *)
let () =
]}


The statements in this list use several helper functions, such as [add_unqualified], [add_qualified],
[add_binary], etc.

The core function of these is [add_qualified], which registers a function based on:
{ol
 {- The name of the function}
 {- The return type (an [UnsizedType.returntype])}
 {- A list of argument types (A list of [UnsizedType.autodifftype * UnsizedType.t] tuples)}
 {- The memory pattern supported by this function, Array of Structs (AoS) or Struct of Arrays (SoA)}
}

All other functions are simply helpers for calling this one. For example, if a function does not have
any arguments it requires to be of type [data], then [add_unqualified] is provided for convience. It
does the same thing as [add_qualfied], but the third argument is just a list of [UnsizedType.t]s.
Other helpers, such as [add_binary], exist for common cases such as a function with a signature
[(real, real) => real]

If a function has multiple signatures, it will generally need multiple calls to these functions.
Some helpers, such as [add_binary_vec] add multiple signatures at once for vectorized functions.

For example, the following line defines the signature [add(real, matrix) => matrix]

{[
  add_unqualified ("add", ReturnType UMatrix, [UReal; UMatrix], SoA) ;
]}

{1 Higher-Order Variadic functions}

Functions such as the ODE integrators or [reduce_sum], which take in user-functions and a variable-length
list of arguments, are {b NOT} added to this list.

"Nice" variadic functions are added to the hashtable [Stan_math_signatures.stan_math_variadic_signatures].
This is probably sufficient for most variadic functions, e.g. all the ODE solvers and DAE solvers are done
via this method.
[reduce_sum] is not "nice", since it is both variadic and {e polymorphic}, requiring certain arguments to have the same
(but {e not predetermined}) type. Therefore, [reduce_sum] is treated as special case in the [Typechecker]
module in the frontend folder.

Note that higher-order functions also usually require changes to the C++ code generation to work properly.
It is best to consult an existing example of how these are done before proceeding.

{1 Testing}

Functions exposed from the Stan Math Library are tested for all declared signatures. These tests live
in the folder [test/integration/good/function-signatures]. They consist of a basic Stan program (or
multiple programs for functions with a large number of overloads) which call the new function on each
possible combination of arguments.

These tests confirm both that the typechecker accepts these signatures and that the C++ generated
for them compiles against the Math Library implementations.

{1 Documentation}

Finally, before a function can be exposed in the Stan compiler it needs to be added to the Stan
Functions Reference, which is stored at {{:https://github.com/stan-dev/docs}stan-dev/docs}.
New PRs to stanc3 will prompt you to link to the accompanying documentation PR.
