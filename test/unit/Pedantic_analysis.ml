      Warning:
        Your Stan program has a parameter sigma_e with a lower and upper bound in

        reasons: (a) Except when there are logical or physical constraints, it is

        can cause difficulties for Stan's sampling algorithm. As a consequence, we
        recommend soft constraints rather than hard constraints; for example,
        instead of constraining an elasticity parameter to fall between 0, and 1,
        leave it unconstrained and give it a normal(0.5,0.5) prior distribution.
