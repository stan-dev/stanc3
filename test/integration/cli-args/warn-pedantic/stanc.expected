Warning: Your Stan program has a parameter d with a lower and upper bound in

Warning: Your Stan program has a parameter sigma_e with a lower and upper
    bound in its declaration. These hard constraints are not recommended, for
    two reasons: (a) Except when there are logical or physical constraints,
    it is very unusual for you to be sure that a parameter will fall inside a
    specified range, and (b) The infinite gradient induced by a hard
    constraint can cause difficulties for Stan's sampling algorithm. As a
    consequence, we recommend soft constraints rather than hard constraints;
    for example, instead of constraining an elasticity parameter to fall
    between 0, and 1, leave it unconstrained and give it a normal(0.5,0.5)
    prior distribution.
Warning: The parameter x has 6 priors.
